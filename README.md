# Hello!

My name is Jan

## Why I want to code?

I want to change my career path. 
I am excited about the vision of working in such a dynamic and perspective environment. 
With programming I have opportunity to turn my ideas into reality. 
World is changing - I want to be a part of this process. 
But of course it's not that easy. 
I need special tools - like programmming and skills to do it.
Everything I need to do it I have in Academy ;)
